Dance Evolution (free)

Im presenting my bank for Ambika synth. It covers somehow sounds of dance music in idea of '90. In reality its rather '90, '00 and a little touch of Italo Disco.
You'll find there mainly solo leads, organs, basses, pads, choirs (i call them Choruses) and many more.
Enjoy

To use these presets as i designed them you have to turn on all 6 cards of your Ambika. These voices are highly detuned and they sounds good only that way.
Im attaching MULTI preset for that. Just copy to your SD card. When Ambika is on in "Library" at page "Multi" choose "More" and then "->ini". From now everytime you turn on your Ambika will be ready to play my presets.
